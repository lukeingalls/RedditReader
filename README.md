This is a program to create a video from an r/askreddit post. It will accept up to 2 command line arguments. The first HAS to be the URL of the post you intend to be converted into the video format. The second is a string to add to the final name of the output file (helps for when this program is called repeatedly and the source is incrementing in a for fasion. Neither argument is needed though; if no arguments are passed the top post from the day the program is run will be used.

That's really it. Not really well written just made it functional.

The mpeg files ought to be in the folder (of the program) when the program is run. I think it ought to work without them but it will look a little less polished.
